# WordPress OOP Plugin Boilperplate
Created and maintained as I progress through my education of building a WordPress plugin in the OOP environment. 

## Requirements
- PHP >7.0.1
- Composer
- Twig template engine

## Utility Notes
* In-house templating method used for metaboxes; etc
* Metaboxes use native WordPress open/close logic for section widgets
* General image creator generates the html markup for an image with passed in URL
* Uses Composer for autoloading and namespacing

## Pull Requests
PRs are welcome!
